# Syneos Healthcare - Patient Dashboard Project

Welcome to the Syneos Healthcare Patient Dashboard project repository! This project is dedicated to the development of an advanced dashboard system designed to visualize and analyze patient data within the healthcare domain. The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of various vital factors, including heart rate, blood pressure, SpO2 level, hemoglobin (hb), creatinine, urea, patient status (discharged, ICU, expired), smoking and drinking habits, total ICU stay duration, name, age, gender, total admissions so far, and unique admission number.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to revolutionize healthcare analytics by offering an interactive and insightful dashboard tailored to meet the needs of healthcare professionals. By harnessing the power of data visualization and analytics, the dashboard aims to enhance decision-making processes, optimize patient care strategies, and improve overall healthcare outcomes.

## Key Features
- **Visualization of Vital Signs**: The dashboard provides intuitive visualizations of vital signs, enabling healthcare professionals to monitor patient health status effectively and identify trends and patterns.
- **Patient Status Classification**: Patients are classified based on their status, such as discharged, ICU, or expired, facilitating quick identification and prioritization of patient care.
- **Smoking and Drinking Habits Analysis**: The dashboard offers detailed insights into patients' smoking and drinking habits, enabling healthcare providers to assess risks and tailor interventions accordingly.
- **Total ICU Stay Duration Tracking**: Healthcare professionals can track the total duration of patients' ICU stays, facilitating resource allocation and patient management optimization.
- **Comprehensive Patient Profile**: Patient profiles contain essential demographic information, including name, age, gender, total admissions, and unique admission number, ensuring accurate patient identification and tracking.

## DAX Queries
The project leverages extensive Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) queries to implement various conditions and calculations within the Power BI dashboard. DAX queries play a crucial role in categorizing heart rate into bradycardia or tachycardia, classifying blood pressure under different conditions, and analyzing SpO2 levels to assess patient oxygenation status.

## Project Structure
- **Main.pbix**: The Power BI file containing the patient dashboard with interactive visualizations and data analysis.
- **Data**: Folder containing sample patient data used for dashboard development and testing.
- **README.md**: Documentation providing a comprehensive overview of the project, key features, and instructions for usage.
